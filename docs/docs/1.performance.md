## Reflection Cache

ImmuKT needs to know how to get properties from a data class and how to create a new instance of the data class. It is expensive to get this information since it involves reflection. ImmuKT internally keeps a cache of this information for every class it worked with.

It might be a problem if your program creates new classes very often (for example loading classes dynamically from .jar files) If this is your use case, please open an issue!

## Lazy Evaluation

By default, ImmuKT converts draft data class (contains both the original data and the modifications) to an actual data class (a new instance of data class with all the modifications applied) only when that data class is first accessed.

For example:

```kotlin
import site.pegasis.immukt.DataClass
import site.pegasis.immukt.draft.DataDraftList

data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) : DataClass {
    init {
        println("$name inited, $age")
    }
}

val list = listOf(
    Person("Pega", 18) // prints "Pega inited, 18"
)

val newList = DataDraftList.from(list).produceWith {
    it[0][Person::age] = 19
}
// type of newList is List<Person>
// **does not print anything!**

print(newList.size) // prints 1

newList[0].name
// **modified data class first accessed here**
// **prints "Pega inited, 19"**
```
